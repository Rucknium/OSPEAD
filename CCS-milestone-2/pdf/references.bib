  abstract={CryptoNote is a privacy-focused blockchain protocol. Currently, more than 10 different cryptocurrencies including Monero, a popular cryptocurrency with a 1-year average market cap of 2 billion USD, have been developed based on the CryptoNote&#x2019;s protocol. CryptoNote obscures the connection between inputs and outputs of a transaction by adding decoy inputs. In this paper, we introduce probabilistic attacks to the untraceability of CryptoNote which substantially degrades the level of privacy of CryptoNote-style blockchains. We analyze the effectiveness of the proposed attacks and derive their error rates.},

  abstract = {This paper develops a general framework for conducting inference on the rank of an unknown matrix Π0. A defining feature of our setup is the null hypothesis of the form . The problem is of first-order importance because the previous literature focuses on by implicitly assuming away , which may lead to invalid rank tests due to overrejections. In particular, we show that limiting distributions of test statistics under may not stochastically dominate those under . A multiple test on the nulls , though valid, may be substantially conservative. We employ a testing statistic whose limiting distributions under are highly nonstandard due to the inherent irregular natures of the problem, and then construct bootstrap critical values that deliver size control and improved power. Since our procedure relies on a tuning parameter, a two-step procedure is designed to mitigate concerns on this nuisance. We additionally argue that our setup is also important for estimation. We illustrate the empirical relevance of our results through testing identification in linear IV models that allows for clustered data and inference on sorting dimensions in a two-sided matching model with transferrable utility.},

  abstract = {Summary Non-parametric estimates of mixing proportions based on kernel-type density estimators are badly suited to several types of data. They suffer from aberrations due to rounding or truncation of the measurements, and their construction involves the crucial choice of the “window size”, or smoothing parameter. In many circumstances estimators based on the empiric distribution function would be more suitable, and in this paper we investigate their properties. The estimators we introduce lead in a natural way to non-parametric forms of well-known parametric estimators. Their efficiency approaches 100 per cent as the distances between the component distributions increase.},

Without making parametric assumptions on the component distributions, we investigate how one can identify the number of components from the distribution function of the observed data. When k ≥ 2, a lower bound on the number of components (M) is non-parametrically identifiable from the rank of a matrix constructed from the distribution function of the observed variables. Building on this identification condition, we develop a procedure to estimate a lower bound on the number of components consistently.},

We use as motivation the cryptocurrency protocol CryptoNote 2.0 ostensibly published by Nicolas van Saberhagen in 2012. It has been previously demonstrated that the untraceability obscuring a one-time key pair can be dependent upon the untraceability of all of the keys used in composing that ring signature. This allows for the possibility of chain reactions in traceability between ring signatures, causing a critical loss in untraceability across the whole network if parameters are poorly chosen and if an attacker owns a sufficient percentage of the network. The signatures are still one-time, however, and any such attack will still not necessarily violate the anonymity of users. However, such an attack could plausibly weaken the resistance CryptoNote demonstrates against blockchain analysis. This research bulletin has not undergone peer review, and reflects only the results of internal investigation.",

Completely automated distribution-free honest finite sample lower confidence bounds are developed for the mixing proportion. Connection to the problem of multiple testing is discussed. The identifiability of the model and the estimation of the density of the unknown distribution are also addressed. We compare the estimators proposed, which are easily implementable, with some of the existing procedures through simulation studies and analyse two data sets: one arising from an application in astronomy and the other from a microarray experiment.},

    abstract = { Abstract A family of probability densities, which has proved useful in modelling the size distributions of various phenomens, including incomes and earnings, human settlement sizes, oil-field volumes and particle sizes, is introduced. The distribution, named herein as the double Pareto-lognormal or dPlN distribution, arises as that of the state of a geometric Brownian motion (GBM), with lognormally distributed initial state, after an exponentially distributed length of time (or equivalently as the distribution of the killed state of such a GBM with constant killing rate). A number of phenomena can be viewed as resulting from such a process (e.g., incomes, settlement sizes), which explains the good fit. Properties of the distribution are derived and estimation methods discussed. The distribution exhibits Paretian power-law) behaviour in both tails, and when plotted on logarithmic axes, its density exhibits hyperbolic-type behaviour. }
