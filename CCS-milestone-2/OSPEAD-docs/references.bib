  abstract={CryptoNote is a privacy-focused blockchain protocol. Currently, more than 10 different cryptocurrencies including Monero, a popular cryptocurrency with a 1-year average market cap of 2 billion USD, have been developed based on the CryptoNote&#x2019;s protocol. CryptoNote obscures the connection between inputs and outputs of a transaction by adding decoy inputs. In this paper, we introduce probabilistic attacks to the untraceability of CryptoNote which substantially degrades the level of privacy of CryptoNote-style blockchains. We analyze the effectiveness of the proposed attacks and derive their error rates.},

We present a constructive identification argument and use it to develop simple two-step estimators of the component distributions and all their functionals. We discuss a computationally efficient method for estimation and derive asymptotic theory. Simulation experiments suggest that our theory provides confidence intervals with good coverage in small samples.},

We build a novel database using a large number of public and proprietary sources to link Bitcoin addresses to real entities and develop an extensive suite of algorithms to extract information about the behavior of the main market participants. We conduct three major pieces of analysis of the Bitcoin eco-system. First, we analyze the transaction volume and network structure of the main participants on the blockchain. Second, we document the concentration and regional composition of the miners which are the backbone of the verification protocol and ensure the integrity of the blockchain ledger. Finally, we analyze the ownership concentration of the largest holders of Bitcoin.},

We use as motivation the cryptocurrency protocol CryptoNote 2.0 ostensibly published by Nicolas van Saberhagen in 2012. It has been previously demonstrated that the untraceability obscuring a one-time key pair can be dependent upon the untraceability of all of the keys used in composing that ring signature. This allows for the possibility of chain reactions in traceability between ring signatures, causing a critical loss in untraceability across the whole network if parameters are poorly chosen and if an attacker owns a sufficient percentage of the network. The signatures are still one-time, however, and any such attack will still not necessarily violate the anonymity of users. However, such an attack could plausibly weaken the resistance CryptoNote demonstrates against blockchain analysis. This research bulletin has not undergone peer review, and reflects only the results of internal investigation.",

 abstract = {We consider a two-component mixture model with one known component. We develop methods for estimating the mixing proportion and the unknown distribution non-parametrically, given independent and identically distributed data from the mixture model, using ideas from shape-restricted function estimation. We establish the consistency of our estimators. We find the rate of convergence and asymptotic limit of the estimator for the mixing proportion. Completely automated distribution-free honest finite sample lower confidence bounds are developed for the mixing proportion. Connection to the problem of multiple testing is discussed. The identifiability of the model and the estimation of the density of the unknown distribution are also addressed. We compare the estimators proposed, which are easily implementable, with some of the existing procedures through simulation studies and analyse two data sets: one arising from an application in astronomy and the other from a microarray experiment.},

    abstract = { Abstract A family of probability densities, which has proved useful in modelling the size distributions of various phenomens, including incomes and earnings, human settlement sizes, oil-field volumes and particle sizes, is introduced. The distribution, named herein as the double Pareto-lognormal or dPlN distribution, arises as that of the state of a geometric Brownian motion (GBM), with lognormally distributed initial state, after an exponentially distributed length of time (or equivalently as the distribution of the killed state of such a GBM with constant killing rate). A number of phenomena can be viewed as resulting from such a process (e.g., incomes, settlement sizes), which explains the good fit. Properties of the distribution are derived and estimation methods discussed. The distribution exhibits Paretian power-law) behaviour in both tails, and when plotted on logarithmic axes, its density exhibits hyperbolic-type behaviour. }
